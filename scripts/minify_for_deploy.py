    TODO
    This will be a script that will prep Topomapper for "production."
    Ideally, it will do the following:
        1. Using something like json-minify (available through npm), minify the datafiles/.
        2. Using something like minify (available through npm), minify js/main.js, /sw.js and /sw_loader.js.
        3. Remove scripts and other content not needed in production (/debug_server.py, scripts/, dotfiles and dotdirectories).
